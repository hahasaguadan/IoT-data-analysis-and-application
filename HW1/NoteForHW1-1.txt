Asking chatgpt steps:
a. write python to solve linear regression problem,following CRISP-DM steps,
   1.generate n random point (x,y), x: -10 to 10, y = a*x+b+c*N(0,variance), where is from -10 to 10,b=50,c is from 0 to 100
   2.draw regression line in red
   3.combine FLASK to allow user can make input and plot at the same page, so the user can change the value by sliding the slider,then the plot will change refresh immediately

b. RuntimeError: main thread is not in main loop,fix the code

c. allow user to modify the number of points(inputs) 

d. remember app.py and index.html as version 1, give me prompt that can generate code version 1



Code prompt:

Generate a Flask-based Python project that includes two files: app.py and index.html. The project should allow the user to modify parameters for a linear regression plot via sliders, with the plot updating dynamically in real-time. The parameters are:

Slope (a): from -10 to 10
Intercept (b): from 0 to 100
Noise factor (c): from 0 to 100
Variance: from 1 to 50
Number of points (n): from 10 to 1000
The regression plot should show the data points in blue and the regression line in red. Use the matplotlib library to generate the plot, and ensure that it is displayed on the same page using Flask. The page should allow the user to adjust the parameters via sliders and see the plot update immediately.

Here is the structure of the project:

app.py - A Flask application that generates a linear regression plot based on user inputs and sends the plot as a base64 image to the frontend.
index.html - An HTML page that contains sliders for the parameters and displays the plot.
Make sure the app uses a non-interactive matplotlib backend (Agg) to handle plots, and the plot is sent to the frontend as a base64-encoded PNG image.
